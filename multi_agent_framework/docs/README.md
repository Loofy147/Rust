# Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform

## Overview
This platform supports advanced, production-grade orchestration of multi-agent workflows, with features for distributed, secure, and extensible operation.

## Key Advanced Features
- Event sourcing & CQRS (core/event_store.py, registry, workflow)
- Federated/multi-cluster registry (edge agent support)
- Service mesh (Istio, deploy/k8s/service-mesh-istio.yaml)
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow steps
- Visual workflow builder (ui/visual_builder/)
- Plugin/workflow marketplace (API stubs)
- Advanced security/compliance (OPA, Vault, PII detection)
- Emergent behavior & ethics/bias analysis
- Edge/federated agent support

## Usage
- See `docs/ADVANCED_FEATURES.md` for details on each feature, usage, and extension.
- Run the orchestrator, agents, and UI as described in the main README.
- Use the REST API for agent/workflow/marketplace operations.
- Use the visual builder for workflow composition.

## Extending
- Connect event store to Kafka/Postgres for production.
- Integrate with real OPA, Vault, and federated registry.
- Expand UI and marketplace as needed.
