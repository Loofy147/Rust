# Advanced Features Overview

This document describes the advanced features implemented in the multi-agent orchestration platform.

---

## 1. Event Sourcing & CQRS
- **Event Store**: All state changes (agent registration, workflow updates, etc.) are persisted as events (see `core/event_store.py`).
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for workflows and registry (see `WorkflowEngine._read_model`).
- **Usage**: Events are automatically emitted by registry and workflow engine. Extend by connecting to Kafka/Postgres for production.

## 2. Federated/Multi-Cluster Registry
- **Federated Sync**: Registry supports syncing agent state across clusters (stub for etcd/Consul/REST in `AgentRegistry._sync_to_peers`).
- **Edge/Federated Agents**: Register and discover edge agents with location metadata.
- **Usage**: Use `/register_edge_agent` and `/edge_agents` API endpoints.

## 3. Service Mesh (Istio)
- **K8s Manifests**: Istio Gateway, VirtualService, and mTLS PeerAuthentication for orchestrator and agent services (`deploy/k8s/service-mesh-istio.yaml`).
- **Usage**: Apply manifests in your K8s cluster with Istio installed.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **Workflow Steps**: Steps can be marked as `hitl: true` in workflow YAML or via the visual builder.
- **API**: Approve HITL steps via `/approve_hitl_step` endpoint.
- **Usage**: Pause workflow execution until human approval is received.

## 5. Visual Workflow Builder
- **React App**: Drag-and-drop workflow builder in `ui/visual_builder/`.
- **Features**: Compose DAGs, mark HITL steps, export YAML.
- **Usage**: `cd ui/visual_builder && npm install && npm start`

## 6. Plugin/Workflow Marketplace
- **API**: List and upload plugins/workflows via `/plugins`, `/upload_plugin`, `/workflows`, `/upload_workflow` endpoints (stubs).
- **Usage**: Extend for UI and real upload support.

## 7. Advanced Security & Compliance
- **OPA Policy Check**: Stub for Open Policy Agent integration (`core/security.py`).
- **Vault Secret Fetch**: Stub for HashiCorp Vault/KMS integration.
- **PII Detection**: Simple PII keyword scan.
- **Usage**: Extend stubs for production security/compliance.

## 8. Emergent Behavior & Ethics/Alignment
- **Logging**: Log agent interactions for emergent behavior analysis (`core/emergent_behavior.py`).
- **Analysis**: Stub for pattern/anomaly detection and ethics/bias checks.
- **Usage**: Extend with ML or rule-based analysis.

## 9. Edge/Federated Agent Support
- **API**: Register and discover edge agents with location metadata.
- **Usage**: `/register_edge_agent`, `/edge_agents` endpoints.

## 10. Data Preparation Agents
- **DataPreparationAgent**: Orchestrates the full data pipeline for ML/LLM training.
- **DataIngestionAgent**: Fetches raw data from files, URLs, or DBs.
- **DataCleaningAgent**: Cleans and normalizes data (deduplication, missing values).
- **DataTransformationAgent**: Feature engineering, tokenization, vectorization.
- **DataLabelingAgent**: Applies or manages labels (manual, weak, or auto).
- **DataSplitAgent**: Splits data into train/val/test sets.
- **DataExportAgent**: Prepares data for downstream ML/LLM training.
- **Usage**: See `config/example_data_workflow.yaml` for a sample workflow chaining these agents. Register your data agents in `config/config.yaml`.

## Extension Notes
- **Production**: Connect event store to Kafka/Postgres, federated registry to etcd/Consul, and security to real OPA/Vault.
- **UI**: Expand visual builder and marketplace for full-featured web experience.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Jaeger for full observability.
- **Testing**: Add integration and fuzz tests for new endpoints and modules.
