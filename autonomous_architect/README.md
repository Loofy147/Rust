# Autonomous Architecture Agent System

An advanced AI engineering orchestration platform for continuous codebase monitoring, intelligent architectural analysis, and adaptive system evolution through autonomous agent coordination.

## Features
- Multi-agent ecosystem with specialized AI engineering agents
- Graph-based codebase intelligence (NetworkX + SQLite)
- Autonomous orchestration and health monitoring
- Machine learning-driven pattern recognition and predictive analytics
- Event-driven, asynchronous, and extensible architecture

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m autonomous_architect.db  # Initialize DB
```

## Example Usage

```python
from autonomous_architect.orchestrator import AutonomousArchitectureOrchestrator
from autonomous_architect.config import default_config

orchestrator = AutonomousArchitectureOrchestrator(default_config)
# await orchestrator.start_orchestration()
```
