## Features
- Pluggable LLM, KG, vector store, and metrics
- REST API (FastAPI) for task management
- WebSocket for live task updates
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Robust error handling and retries
- Persistence for KG and vectors
- Secure API key authentication
- Hot plugin reload in development
- Mock plugins and sample data for local/dev
- Typer-based CLI for dev utilities
- Pre-commit hooks, dev container, strict type checking, and test coverage

---

## Architecture

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for a full diagram and explanat
**Summary:**
- REST API receives tasks, handled by ReasoningAgent core
- Plugins for LLM, KG, vector store, and metrics
- WebSocket for live updates
- Prometheus for metrics
- Dockerized for easy deployment

---

## Plugin System
- Plugins are loaded dynamically based on environment/config
- Hot reload supported in dev mode (`DEV_MODE=1`)
- Mock plugins available for local/dev (`MOCK_PLUGINS=1`)
- To add a new plugin, subclass the relevant interface in `agent/interfaces.py` and update `agent/plugin_loader.py`

---

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Use the dev container for instant onboarding (VSCode: "Reopen in Container")
4. Set environment variables in `.env` (see below)
5. Run the API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

---

## Development Workflow
- Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Check types: `mypy .`
- Format code: `black . && isort .`
- Use the Typer CLI for common tasks (see below)
- Use mock plugins and sample data for local development
- Enable hot plugin reload with `DEV_MODE=1`

---

## CLI Usage

Use the Typer-based CLI for common dev tasks:

```bash
python manage.py seed           # Seed the KG and vector store with sample data
python manage.py clear          # Clear the KG database
python manage.py test           # Run all tests
python manage.py typecheck      # Run mypy type checks
python manage.py reload-plugins # Enable DEV_MODE for hot plugin reload (restart API after)
```

---

## Environment Variables
- `API_KEY`: API key for REST endpoints
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI LLM)
- `DB_URL`: Database URL for KG (e.g., `sqlite:///kg.db`)
- `LLM_PLUGIN`: LLM plugin to use (`openai` or `mock`)
- `KG_PLUGIN`: KG plugin to use (`sqlalchemy`)
- `VECTOR_PLUGIN`: Vector store plugin to use (`chroma`)
- `METRICS_PLUGIN`: Metrics plugin to use (`print`)
- `DEV_MODE`: Set to `1` to enable hot plugin reload
- `MOCK_PLUGINS`: Set to `1` to use mock plugins for local/dev

---

## Testing & Coverage
- Run all tests: `pytest`
- Check type safety: `mypy .`
- Coverage report: `pytest --cov`

---

## Deployment
- **Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- **Production:**
  - Set all required environment variables
  - Use a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
  - Use a production LLM plugin and secure API keys
  - Monitor `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus

---

## Extending the System
- **Add a new plugin:**
  1. Subclass the relevant interface in `agent/interfaces.py`
  2. Implement your plugin in `agent/plugins/`
  3. Update `agent/plugin_loader.py` to support your plugin
- **Add a new API endpoint:**
  - Add to `api/main.py` and update `api/schemas.py` as needed
- **Add a new CLI command:**
  - Add to `manage.py` using Typer
- **Add new tests:**
  - Place in `tests/` and ensure coverage
