# Orchestration Patterns

This document describes orchestration patterns and the Orchestrator class in the Super Advanced Agent Framework.

## Orchestrator Class

Coordinates multiple agents, routes tasks, manages workflows, and supports advanced patterns like chaining, fallback, and supervision.

### Initialization
```python
from orchestrator_demo import Orchestrator
orchestrator = Orchestrator()
```

### Registering Agents
```python
orchestrator.register_agent("retriever", retriever)
orchestrator.register_agent("summarizer", summarizer)
# ...
```

### Routing
Route queries to the appropriate agent by task or user.
```python
result = orchestrator.route("Paris", task="summarize", top_k=3)
result = orchestrator.route("secret", user_id="user1", task="personal")
```

### Chaining
Chain agent calls (e.g., retrieve â†’ summarize).
```python
result = orchestrator.chain("museum", ["retriever", "summarizer"], top_k=3)
```

### Fallback
Fallback to a backup agent if the primary fails.
```python
result = orchestrator.fallback("museum", primary="retriever", backup="hybrid", top_k=2)
```

### Supervision
Monitor and log agent stats.
```python
orchestrator.supervise()
```

## Hierarchical Orchestration
- Use a supervisor agent to delegate tasks to sub-agents based on type or complexity.
- Example: Supervisor routes simple queries to RetrieverAgent, complex ones to SummarizerAgent.

## Task Queue Orchestration
- Integrate with Celery, RQ, or similar for distributed, asynchronous task assignment.
- Agents can be run as workers, orchestrator as a producer.

## Best Practices
- Register all agents at startup.
- Use clear task names and agent roles for routing.
- Implement error handling and logging in all orchestration flows.
- For distributed setups, expose orchestrator via REST/gRPC.

## Extension Points
- Add new orchestration patterns (e.g., voting, consensus, agent collaboration).
- Support dynamic agent spawning and scaling.
- Integrate with monitoring and health check systems.
