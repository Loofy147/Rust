--- All agents are running. Orchestrator will issue commands. ---

Step 1: Orchestrator requests a repository clone.
DataCollectorAgent is running.

--- DataCreatorAgent [SIMULATION]: Processing 'https://github.com/example/repo-to-simulate' ---
DataCreatorAgent [SIMULATION]: Generated 3 fake files.
--- DataCreatorAgent [SIMULATION]: Published REPO_DATA_EXTRACTED event. ---

DataCollectorAgent: Received 'repo_data_extracted' event.
DataCollectorAgent: Buffered 3 items. New buffer size: 3.

Step 2: Orchestrator sends some raw text data for variety.

--- Commands sent. Waiting for the pipeline to process and for the collector to flush (max 6 seconds)... ---
DataCollectorAgent: Received 'raw_text_data' event.
DataCollectorAgent: Buffered 1 raw text item. New buffer size: 4.
DataCollectorAgent: Received 'raw_text_data' event.
DataCollectorAgent: Buffered 1 raw text item. New buffer size: 5.

!!!! DataCollectorAgent: FLUSH! Publishing UNIFIED_DATA_BATCH with 5 items. !!!!
